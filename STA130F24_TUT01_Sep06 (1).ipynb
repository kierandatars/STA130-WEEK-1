    "## üöß üèóÔ∏è (Using notebooks and ChatBots) Demo [45 minutes]  \n",
    "      \n",
    "#### 1. *[About 8 of the 45 minutes]* Demonstrate going to the course [Quercus homepage](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/354091); accessing the [Course GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pointOfive/STA130_ChatGPT); opening new and uploaded notebooks on [UofT Jupyterhub](https://datatools.utoronto.ca) (classic jupyter notebook, or jupyterhub is fine, or students may use [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)); and using Jupyter notebooks as a \"`Python` calculator\" and editing [\"Markdown cells\"](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details class=\"details-example\"><summary style=\"color:blue\"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is all simple and pretty obvious intended to be that way so students get that they can do this on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. *[About 30 of the 45 minutes]* Demonstrate using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (or [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) if conversation privacy is desired) to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. find an (a) \"amusing, funny, or otherwise interesting dataset\" which (b) has missing values and is (c) available online through a URL link to a csv file;\n",
    "2. load the data into the notebook with `pandas` and get \"missing data counts\" for the dataset;\n",
    "3. prompt the ChatBot to \"Please provide a summary of our interaction for submitting as part of the requirements of an assignment\"; and, to \"Please provide me with the final working verson of the code that we created\"<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details class=\"details-example\"><summary style=\"color:blue\"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The intention here is to demonstrate that [at the current GPT4.0-ish level] the ChatBot (with probably about an 80% chance) **cannot fullfil all the requests of the inquiry (of (a) \"funny or amusing\" nature, (b) the presence of missingness, and (c) working url links)** *but will otherwise produce working code*<br><br>\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. ChatBots have a notoriously \"short term memory\"; so, be ready for them to \"forget\" specific details of your prompting requests \n",
    "> 2. ChatBots often cannot pivot away substantially from initial answers; so, be ready for your efforts at follow up and correction with the ChatBot to prove frustratingly futile (which, may in this case actually have a lot to do with the following fact, that...)\n",
    "> 3. ChatBots don't seem to be very aware of the contents of datasets that are avalable online (or even working url links where datasets are); so, ChatBot are not currently a substitue for exploring dataset repository such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) (or other data repositiory resources) and reviewing data yourself (although, ChatBot interactions can nonetheless be help with brainstorm dataset ideas and provide a way to \"search for content\", perhaps especially when referencing a specific website in the conversation)<br><br>\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Examples of this task going pretty well are available [here](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/COP/SLS/00006_copilot_funnyamusingNAdatasetV3.md), [here](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/COP/SLS/00007_copilot_funnyamusingNAdatasetV4.md), and [here](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/GPT/SLS/00001_gpt3p5_villagersdata.md); while, examples of this going poorly are available [here](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/COP/SLS/00002_copilot_funnyamusingNAdataset.md) and [here](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/GPT/SLS/00002_gpt3p5_funnyasusingNAdataset.md). Successes and failures are found within the Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT ChatBots both, suggesting the quality of the results likely has to do more with \"randomness\" and perhaps the nature of the prompting and engagement as opposed to the actual ChatBot version being used...\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. *[About 7 of the 45 minutes]* Demonstrate saving your python jupyter notebook in your own account and \"repo\" on [github.com](https://github.com), and sharing (a) notebook links, (b), ChatBot transcript log links, (c) ChatBot summaries through a piazza post and a Quercus announcement (so students can use this later for their homework assignment if they wish)<br><br>\n"
